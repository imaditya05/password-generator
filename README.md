![Password Generator](assets/images/password-generator-screenshot.png)

This is a web application that generates unique passwords with different combinations of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The user can customize the length of the password and select which character sets to include in the generated password.

## Usage

The user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive. The user can select the desired length of the password by moving the slider. The user can also select which character sets to include by checking the corresponding checkboxes.

Once the user is satisfied with their selection, they can click on the "GENERATE PASSWORD" button to generate a new password. The generated password will appear in the text area.

The user can copy the password to their clipboard by clicking the copy icon. The password will automatically be copied to the clipboard, and a message will appear briefly to confirm that the password has been copied.
